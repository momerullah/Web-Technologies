This project is a part of Homework 1 for CSC 436: Web Applications. The homework is split into two main parts:

### Part 1: HTML Using Bootstrap

To Load the JS and CSS components:

### `npm start`

In this part, a simple HTML personal biography page has been created using Bootstrap. The biography page makes use of Bootstrap CSS styling and contains:
- A brief introduction and biography.
- A responsive image.
- Navigation links.
- A custom favicon, representing DePaul University's logo.

The project utilizes local Bootstrap CSS, and the page has been styled using a custom CSS file, `cover.css`.

You can access my Biography Page using: https://momerullah.github.io/Web-Applications/

### Submission
The project has been initialized as a Git repository and has been pushed to GitHub.
